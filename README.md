# ðŸš² HomeBikeManager

Welcome to HomeBikeManager! This is a humble, work-in-progress Flask REST API for managing your bikes, parts, rides, and maintenance schedules. It's not going to win any design awards, but it gets the job done (eventually). ðŸ˜…

## System Overview

## Automation Scripts
See [docs/scripts.md](docs/scripts.md) for helper scripts, including `scripts/sync_docs_to_wiki.py` to copy docs/ to the wiki repo.

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repo (if you dare)
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\\Scripts\\activate on Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the app locally:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
4. Or build and run with Docker:
   ```sh
   docker build -t homebikemanager .
   docker run -p 5000:5000 homebikemanager
   ```
5. Run the tests (if you trust them):
   ```sh
   pytest tests/
   ```

## API Endpoints
- `/api/register` â€“ Register a new user (because you can't remember your old password)
- `/api/login` â€“ Get an API key
- `/api/bikes` â€“ CRUD for bikes
- `/api/parts` â€“ CRUD for parts
- `/api/rides` â€“ (coming soon)
- `/api/calendar` â€“ (coming soon)

## What Works
- User registration & login
- API key authentication
- CRUD for bikes and parts
- Automated tests (pytest)
- Logging (so you can see what broke)

## What Doesn't (Yet)
- Rides and file uploads (GPX/KML)
- Calendar events
- Anything fancy
